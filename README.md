# JSON Diff Studio

A sleek, desktop-optimized web application for comparing JSON documents with intelligent diff highlighting and formatting tools.

## Features

- **Dual JSON Editors**: Paste or type JSON in two side-by-side CodeMirror editors with line numbers
- **Smart Formatting**: Beautify JSON with customizable indentation (spaces or tabs)
- **Intelligent Diffing**: Compare JSON objects and highlight differences:
  - 🔴 **Missing values** (red)
  - 🟢 **Added values** (green)
  - 🔵 **Minor/time-based changes** (blue)
  - 🟠 **Structural updates** (orange)
- **Code Editor Features**: Syntax highlighting, auto-close brackets, bracket matching, and line wrapping
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop screens with a modern dark theme
- **Merged JSON View**: Displays a unified JSON document with inline color coding for changes, plus options to sort keys alphabetically and transform key casing (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, kebab-case, UPPER_CASE)
- **Comparison Timeline**: Detailed list of all differences with contextual information

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Paste your original JSON in the left editor
3. Paste the modified JSON in the right editor
4. Use the "Format" buttons to beautify individual editors or "Beautify both" for both
5. Adjust indentation settings as needed (size and type)
6. Click "Compare JSON" to see the differences
